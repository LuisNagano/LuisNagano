I am a passionate data scientist and bioinformatician with 8 years of experience, specializing in clinical, cancer, and developmental biology data analysis. My expertise in R, Python, Bash (Unix Shell), and Perl, combined with strong skills in machine learning, statistical analysis, and bioinformatics, allows me to derive impactful insights from complex datasets.

Throughout my career, I have contributed to several scientific projects aimed at discovering novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets, with a focus on improving the prognosis and treatment of pediatric cancers. My work is grounded in data science, leveraging advanced algorithms and statistical methods to translate raw data into actionable insights.

I have published multiple articles in international journals and have experience presenting research at scientific conferences, where I was recognized for my contributions to pediatric oncology.

I pride myself on my ability to communicate complex data in a clear, accessible way, making sure that insights are not only understood but also actionable. My critical thinking, problem-solving abilities, and deep curiosity about science and technology drive me to continuously improve and innovate.

  This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to classify molecular subgroups in medulloblastoma (MB) using lncRNA expression profiles from 167 MB samples. Using the ConsensusClusterPlus package in R, we identified four robust molecular subgroups corresponding to the known subtypes: Group 3, Group 4, SHH, and WNT. Validation with Cohenâ€™s Kappa coefficient showed excellent agreement between the lncRNA-based classification and the original subgroups.
