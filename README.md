I'm a data scientist and bioinformatician with a passion for technology.

I currently develop projects that prioritize solving business problems, from understanding them, analyzing data, to extracting insights and implementing the solution. I also continue to develop myself with improvement and study activities such as a portfolio of data science projects and I also write about the same topic on a blog on [Medium](your-medium-url).

For more details about my projects and each solution, they are described in the data science project section.

## Analytics Tools

- **Data Collection and Storage:** MySQL and PostgreSQL.
- **Data Processing and Analytics:** Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy.
- **Development:** Python, Git, and Clean Code.
- **Data Visualization:** Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- **Machine Learning Modeling:** Classification, Regression, Clusterization, Time Series, and Neural Network.
- **Machine Learning Deployment:** Flask and Docker.

## Data Science Projects

- <h3><a href="your-olist-delivery-forecast-link" style="text-decoration: underline;">Olist Delivery Forecast</a></h3>
  Olist is the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. This project aims to develop and implement a model to predict the time in days until the delivery of a given product. *in progress*

- <h3><a href="your-airbnb-scheduling-forecast-link" style="text-decoration: underline;">Airbnb Scheduling Forecast</a></h3>
  To help the booking of the Airbnb this data science project aim to create a machine learning model to predict the first booking of a new user. Unfortunately the database is very desbalanced which difficult the prediction of the model, the best result was 17.48% +/- 0.4% of accuracy. Therefore new approaches guided by the business will be necessary to improve the results.

- <h3><a href="your-health-insurance-cross-sell-link" style="text-decoration: underline;">Health Insurance Cross Sell</a></h3>
  To help the sales team, this data science project was created to sort a list to improve the cross-selling. The model was able to organize that almost all interested customers (98.31% +/- 0.16%) stay on up to 50% of the list, saving half of the expenses incurred for calls. Using the model it is possible to spend only R$ 150,000.00.

- <h3><a href="your-transaction-fraud-detection-link" style="text-decoration: underline;">Transaction Fraud Detection</a></h3>
  Financial transactions fraud is one of the biggest problems faced by financial institutions. Thus, this project uses data science and machine learning to detect and avoid fraudulent transactions. The profit expected by the company is R$ 57,251,574.44.

- <h3><a href="your-churn-prediction-link" style="text-decoration: underline;">Churn Prediction</a></h3>
  When a client churns, it represents a problem, which results in money loss for the company. This project created a solution using data to predict such behavior and avoid it. It represents a recovery of R$ 2,878,197.97 for the company.

- <h3><a href="your-cardiovascular-disease-prediction-link" style="text-decoration: underline;">Cardiovascular Disease Prediction</a></h3>
  Cardio Catch Disease is a company specialized in detecting heart diseases in early stages. The estimated profit generated by using this model may be about R$ 11,285,500.00.

- <h3><a href="your-rossman-store-sales-link" style="text-decoration: underline;">Rossman Store Sales</a></h3>
  This data science project created a machine learning model able to predict the sales up to six weeks in advance, enabling them to calculate the profit per store and the amount of money available to invest.


## Data Engineering Projects

- <h3><a href="your-bookclub-data-storing-link" style="text-decoration: underline;">Bookclub Data Storing</a></h3>
  The Bookclub doesn't collect the data from its website, however they are updated with each purchase, sale or exchange that takes place on the website. For this purpose, this project aims to collect, transforma and load (ETL) data from the website books.toscrape for a MySQL database. The ETL is scheduled using Airflow. Both MySQL and Airflow platform were active using Docker.

- <h3><a href="your-metrics-para-regressao-link" style="text-decoration: underline;">Metrics para RegressÃ£o: Entendendo as mÃ©tricas RÂ², MAE, MAPE, MSE e RMSE</a></h3>
  In the post "Metrics for Regression: Understanding RÂ², MAE, MAPE, MSE, and RMSE Metrics", title in english, I wrote about metrics for regression models. The selected metrics were RÂ², Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). During this post I explain about the calculation of metrics and how to interpret them.

- <h3><a href="your-indo-alem-da-acuracia-link" style="text-decoration: underline;">Indo AlÃ©m da AcurÃ¡cia: Entendo a AcurÃ¡cia Balanceada, PrecisÃ£o, Recall e F1 score</a></h3>
  The post "Going Beyond Accuracy: Understanding Balanced Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 score", title in english, I wrote about metrics to avaliate models of classification. The metrics covered were Balanced Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1 score. During the post, I talk about how to calculate these metrics and understand them.

- <h3><a href="your-escolha-suas-palavras-link" style="text-decoration: underline;">Escolha as suas palavras: uma introduÃ§Ã£o Ã s expressÃµes regulares e ao seu entendimento.</a></h3>
  The post "Choose Your Words: An introduction to regular expressions and understanding them", title in english, I wrote a introduction about regular expression. Each expression is presented with its functionality within a sentence, along with an example.

- <h3><a href="your-feature-engineering-link" style="text-decoration: underline;">Feature Engineering: TÃ©cnicas para lidar com dados faltantes em um projeto de ciÃªncia de dados.</a></h3>
  The post "Feature Engineering: Techniques for dealing with missing data in a data science project", title in english, I wrote about techniques for dealing with missing data. Each technique presented is explained along with examples. Some of the techniques covered "removal of missing data", "mean or median imputation", "categorical imputation" and "missing value indicator".
