I'm a data scientist and bioinformatician with a passion for technology.

I currently develop projects that prioritize solving business problems, from understanding them, analyzing data, to extracting insights and implementing the solution. I also continue to develop myself with improvement and study activities such as a portfolio of data science projects and I also write about the same topic on a blog on [Medium](your-medium-url).

For more details about my projects and each solution, they are described in the data science project section.

## Analytics Tools

- **Data Collection and Storage:** MySQL and PostgreSQL.
- **Data Processing and Analytics:** Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, NumPy.
- **Development:** Python, Git, and Clean Code.
- **Data Visualization:** Seaborn and Matplotlib.
- **Machine Learning Modeling:** Classification, Regression, Clusterization, Time Series, and Neural Network.
- **Machine Learning Deployment:** Flask and Docker.

## Data Science Projects

- <h3><a href="your-olist-delivery-forecast-link" style="text-decoration: underline;">Olist Delivery Forecast</a></h3>
  Olist is the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. This project aims to develop and implement a model to predict the time in days until the delivery of a given product. *in progress*

- <h3><a href="your-airbnb-scheduling-forecast-link" style="text-decoration: underline;">Airbnb Scheduling Forecast</a></h3>
  To help the booking of the Airbnb this data science project aim to create a machine learning model to predict the first booking of a new user. Unfortunately the database is very desbalanced which difficult the prediction of the model, the best result was 17.48% +/- 0.4% of accuracy. Therefore new approaches guided by the business will be necessary to improve the results.

- <h3><a href="your-health-insurance-cross-sell-link" style="text-decoration: underline;">Health Insurance Cross Sell</a></h3>
  To help the sales team, this data science project was created to sort a list to improve the cross-selling. The model was able to organize that almost all interested customers (98.31% +/- 0.16%) stay on up to 50% of the list, saving half of the expenses incurred for calls. Using the model it is possible to spend only R$ 150,000.00.

- <h3><a href="your-transaction-fraud-detection-link" style="text-decoration: underline;">Transaction Fraud Detection</a></h3>
  Financial transactions fraud is one of the biggest problems faced by financial institutions. Thus, this project uses data science and machine learning to detect and avoid fraudulent transactions. The profit expected by the company is R$ 57,251,574.44.

- <h3><a href="your-churn-prediction-link" style="text-decoration: underline;">Churn Prediction</a></h3>
  When a client churns, it represents a problem, which results in money loss for the company. This project created a solution using data to predict such behavior and avoid it. It represents a recovery of R$ 2,878,197.97 for the company.

- <h3><a href="your-cardiovascular-disease-prediction-link" style="text-decoration: underline;">Cardiovascular Disease Prediction</a></h3>
  Cardio Catch Disease is a company specialized in detecting heart diseases in early stages. The estimated profit generated by using this model may be about R$ 11,285,500.00.

- <h3><a href="your-rossman-store-sales-link" style="text-decoration: underline;">Rossman Store Sales</a></h3>
  This data science project created a machine learning model able to predict the sales up to six weeks in advance, enabling them to calculate the profit per store and the amount of money available to invest.
